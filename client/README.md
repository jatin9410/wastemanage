# PRECycle

### Get rid of the recyclable waste!!

> WebApp for Recyclable Waste Management.

### Overview

-PRECycle is a service which helps you to sell your old and throw away stuff in an organized manner.
It is as easy as calling or dropping us a note and.. Kaboom! You get rid of your stuff just like that!
-The site would be having three portal for:

1.**The local scrap dealers**.

2.**The local riders or ragpickers**.

3.**The civilians willing to sell the waste**.

### Goals:

Our project aims at reducing the gap between the people who are willing to recycle the waste and the people looking for customers to buy it from.

- It will eliminate any kind of third party involvement thereby ensuring that the total profit that the worker deserves goes to the worker only.
- It will help in promoting the local services available at a particular time in a particular location.

### Tech Stacks Required:

- Website(Mern Stack)
- Future needs:
  - Machine learning to suggest testimonials and filter out NSFW content.
  - We can add realtime mapping of the riders to the sellers and the vendors.
  - Cloud to deploy the website.

### Limitations (if any):

The fact that local ragpickers still are not comfortable with using apps and websites.
